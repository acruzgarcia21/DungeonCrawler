# Dungeon Prototype (C++ Console Game)

A text-based dungeon exploration prototype written entirely in **C++** and played directly in the **terminal**.  
This project focuses on building the core logic behind a dungeon crawler — movement, combat, progression, and data structures — without relying on any external graphics library.  
It serves as an early prototype before moving into more advanced, graphical game development.

---

## Purpose

This project was created as a way to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **core game logic and systems design**
- Practice **C++ programming** without the aid of a game engine
- Learn to manage **state**, **player stats**, and **enemy interactions**
- Build a foundation for future C++/SFML or engine-based dungeon games

The goal is to understand how games actually work under the hood before adding visuals.

## Features Implemented

- Turn-based dungeon movement system  
- Randomly generated rooms and encounters  
- Player and enemy combat mechanics  
- Health, damage, and experience tracking  
- Inventory placeholders and consumables  
- Simple menu navigation through keyboard input  
- Modular design for easy future expansion

## Planned Improvements

- Add weapon and item systems  
- Implement procedural dungeon generation  
- Add save/load functionality using file I/O  
- Introduce difficulty scaling and boss encounters  
- Experiment with colored console output and ASCII art for better feedback

## Learning Goals

Through this prototype, I’m focusing on:
- Strengthening **C++ fundamentals** — loops, conditionals, functions, and classes  
- Designing and managing **game state machines**  
- Structuring logic cleanly for **reusability and scalability**  
- Understanding how **input, output, and memory** interact in a live loop  
- Laying the groundwork for transitioning to SFML or other frameworks later
